/**
 * Task Mutations Custom Hook
 * 
 * This custom React hook encapsulates all task-related mutation operations using React Query.
 * It provides a clean interface for UI components to perform CRUD operations on tasks
 * without needing to handle the complexity of API calls, error handling, or cache management.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Automatic cache invalidation after mutations
 * - User-friendly toast notifications for all operations
 * - Consistent error handling across all mutations
 * - Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
 * - Type-safe API calls using shared schemas
 * 
 * This hook follows the separation of concerns principle by keeping mutation logic
 * separate from UI components, making the code more testable and reusable.
