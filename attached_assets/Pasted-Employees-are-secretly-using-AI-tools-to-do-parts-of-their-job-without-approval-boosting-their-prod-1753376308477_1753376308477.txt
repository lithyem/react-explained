Nations view AI supremacy as a new kind of arms race – whoever leads in AI, whether in economic innovation or military tech, could hold a strategic global advantage in the coming decade.
~~~
A major AI breakthrough by one country or corporation could upset the geopolitical balance, making leadership in key AI capabilities a matter of national security.
~~~
The immense cost of building cutting-edge AI means only tech giants and wealthy governments can afford it, potentially leaving smaller players dependent on whatever the AI superpowers decide to offer.
~~~
Within industries, leaders who leverage AI can oversee far larger operations effectively, widening the gap between high-tech, data-driven enterprises and those sticking to traditional methods.
~~~
AI could contribute an enormous $15 trillion to the global economy by 2030, but whether that wealth is broadly shared or concentrated among a few will profoundly shape society.
~~~
After a long productivity slump, AI’s rapid adoption hints at finally boosting economic output – by automating drudge work and augmenting skilled work – even if official metrics haven’t fully caught up yet.
