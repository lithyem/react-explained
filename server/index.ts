 * Express Server Entry Point
 * 
 * This file serves as the main entry point for the Express.js application server.
 * It configures middleware, sets up routing, handles errors, and starts the server.
 * The server supports both development (with Vite integration) and production modes.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Express.js web server with JSON and URL-encoded body parsing
 * - Request/response logging middleware for API monitoring
 * - Error handling with proper status codes and JSON responses
 * - Development mode with Vite hot module replacement
 * - Production mode with static file serving
 * - Configurable port binding with fallback defaults

 * - Filters logging to only API routes (paths starting with /api)
 * - Truncates long log messages to prevent console spam
 * - Provides detailed request/response information for debugging
