# TaskFlow - Task Management Application

A modern, full-stack task management application built with React, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. This project demonstrates best practices in TypeScript development, API design, and user interface construction with comprehensive documentation throughout.

## What This Application Does

TaskFlow is a clean, intuitive task management system that allows users to:

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with descriptive titles
- **Track Progress**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with timestamps
- **Organize Work**: View tasks organized by completion status
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately with optimistic UI updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Live Demo

This application runs on Replit and can be accessed through the web preview. Simply click the "Run" button to start the development server and view the application.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible design
- **React Query** for efficient server state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for robust form handling

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for the REST API server
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **PostgreSQL** with Neon serverless hosting for data persistence
- **Zod schemas** for request/response validation

### Shared Code
- **TypeScript types** shared between client and server
- **Database schema** definitions used across the stack
- **Validation schemas** ensuring data consistency

## Architecture Highlights

### Type Safety Across the Stack
Every layer of the application uses TypeScript with shared types between client and server, ensuring compile-time safety and excellent developer experience.

### Modern React Patterns
- Server state management with React Query
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Component composition with shadcn/ui
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### RESTful API Design
- Clean REST endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Structured error responses with appropriate status codes
- Request validation using Zod schemas
- Centralized error handling

### Database Design
- Simple, focused schema optimized for task management
- Automatic timestamp tracking for creation and completion
- Type-safe ORM operations with Drizzle

## Documentation Features

### Learning-Focused Content
The documentation is written with learning in mind, explaining:
- **Why** certain technical decisions were made
- **How** different parts of the system work together
- **What** patterns and practices are demonstrated
- **When** to use similar approaches in other projects

### Code Examples
Most documentation includes practical code examples showing:
- Common usage patterns
- Integration between components
- Error handling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### Architecture Insights
Detailed explanations of:
- Data flow through the application
- State management strategies
- API design principles
- Database optimization techniques

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (automatically provided in Replit)
- PostgreSQL database (configured via environment variables)

### Running the Application
1. Click the "Run" button in Replit
2. The application will start on port 5000
3. Access the web interface through the Replit preview

### Development Workflow
- **Frontend**: Hot module replacement via Vite
- **Backend**: Automatic restarts with tsx
- **Database**: Migration system with Drizzle Kit
- **Types**: Shared between client and server automatically

## Environment Configuration

The application requires a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable pointing to a PostgreSQL database. In Replit, this can be configured through the Secrets tab.
